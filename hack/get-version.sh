# .dockerignore ignores all files unrelevant for build (e.g. example/*) to only copy relevant source files to the build

# as a dirty work tree.
# Additionally, it filters out changes to the `VERSION` file, as this is currently the only way to inject the
# version-to-build in our pipelines (see https://github.com/gardener/cc-utils/issues/431).
